    <p><strong>Boycotting Israeli </strong>goods is a <i>divisive</i> topic that <i>frequently</i> has political 
        and humanitarian undertones. Economic pressure may promote fairness and equality as well as diplomatic solutions. 
        Opponents contend, however, that it <i><u>unjustly</u></i> singles out Israeli citizens and might impede peace 
        initiatives. Better ways to deal with these problems could be to encourage open 
        efforts and have productive conversations.

    <p><q>If we take action non-violently, <strong>Israel</strong> might change their mind about attacking the <b>Palestinians</b> due to 
        their loss.</q> Advocates state.</p>
   
    <p>Whatever one's position, ethical consumption necessitates making thoughtful choices. It's 
        critical to take into account wider <dfn id="ramifications"></dfn>ramifications, such the <i>effects</i> on the economy and the complexity 
        of the <i><strong>Israel</strong>-<b>Palestinian</b></i> issue.</p>

    <p>One of the primary reasons to boycott <strong>Israeli</strong> products is to pressure the <strong>Israeli</strong> government to end its occupation of <b>Palestinian</b> 
        lands, dismantle illegal settlements, and respect the rights of <b>Palestinians</b>. The ongoing occupation, along with discriminatory 
        laws and practices, has led to widespread human rights violations, including land confiscation, home demolitions, and restrictions 
        on freedom of movement and access to basic services</p>

    <p>Furthermore, boycotting <strong>Israeli</strong> products can contribute to raising awareness about the <i><strong>Israel</strong>-<b>Palestinian</b></i> conflict and the role 
        of economic actors in perpetuating injustice. It encourages consumers to consider the ethical implications of their purchasing 
        decisions and to support companies and products that align with their values of human rights, justice, and peace.</p>

    <p>While some argue that boycotts may harm innocent <strong>Israeli</strong> civilians or hinder dialogue and peace efforts, proponents emphasize 
        <i>that nonviolent economic pressure can be a legitimate and effective means of promoting social and political change</i>. By 
        participating in a boycott of <strong>Israeli</strong> products, individuals can take a stand against <i><u>'oppression'</u></i> and contribute to a more just 
        and equitable future for all people in the region.</p>
    
    <p><blockquote# cite="https://sodapopcraft.com/how-many-pepsi-are-sold-a-day/"></p>
    <p>Every single day there are <b><i><u>154 million</u></i></b> pepsi cans sold worldwide. Imagine these 154 million people just didnt buy a Pepsi can for a day,
    this would create a loss for the shares israel has with <i><b>PepsiCo</b></i>. To do the calculation, each pepsi can cost about 100 rupees. Now, multiply 154 million with a 100. 
    you would get around <b><i>15 billion</i></b> rupees, which is a huge amount. </p>
